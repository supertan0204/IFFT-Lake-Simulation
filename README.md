# IFFT-Lake-Simulation
This is an OpenGL based little lake simulation demo using IFFT algorithm.  The height map of the lake surface is generated by implementing IFFT on a Phillips spectrum texture, using so called compute shaders (GPGPU) to generate in real time. The lighting model is simply Blinn-Phong model and further optimizations are expected.
The final result looks like:
